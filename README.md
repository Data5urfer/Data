The_Anonymizer

This Python routine has been conceived in order to render email lists anonymous, for the treatment of data from surveys that need a unique identification of the responder.
The email addresses themselves are considered normally differentiated enough among each other, at local-part level.
Similarly, it can be used to anonymize everything is sufficiently various.
